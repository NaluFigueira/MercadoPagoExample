# Mercado Pago - Checkout Pro Example

### This is a simple example of how you can accept payments by integrating our [Checkout PRO](https://www.mercadopago.com/developers/en/guides/online-payments/checkout-pro/introduction)

### In this repository you will find two main folders:

- `client`: 
  
    Basic implementation of a checkout, complying with the necessary security requirements to collect sensitive user information.

- `server`: 

    Basic server-side implementation, which provides static client-side resources and allows the collected information to be published directly to our API to create preference and process payment request using our payment button.

## How to run it

Clone or [download](https://github.com/NaluFigueira/MercadoPagoExample/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) this project, move to the server implementation of your choice and follow its README instructions.
